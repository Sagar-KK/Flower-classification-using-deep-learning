# Flower-classification-using-deep-learning
#using simple perceptron.
#This project is simple classification of two different breads of flower based on their features.
#The feature set is provided in code itself .
#The neural network(perceptron) is trained with "Sigmoid activaton fumction" and "root mean squared error function".
#With the new flowers attributes provided the model predicts which category the given flower belongs either red or blue.
